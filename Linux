Absolute = Full address
Full path, no confusion, works from anywhere.
ex:vi /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
Relative = From where you stand
Cloud engineer is inside /home/ubuntu and runs:
cd project
Works only because he is already in correct location.
==============================================================
🔹Kernel Update
Updating the Linux brain (kernel) inside the SAME server.
sudo dnf update kernel
sudo reboot
👉 Same EC2 instance
👉 Same IP
👉 Same disk
👉 Only kernel version changes
🔹 AMI Update
Creating a new machine image (template) with updated software, then launching NEW servers from it.
=====================================================================================================================
1.Kernel (Core of Linux OS)
   A.The Linux Kernel is responsible for directly managing system resources, including:

    Process Management – Schedules processes and handles multitasking.
    Memory Management – Allocates and deallocates RAM efficiently.
    Device Drivers – Acts as an interface between software and hardware.
    File System Management – Manages how data is stored and retrieved.
    Network Management – Handles communication between systems

B.Shell (Command Line Interface - CLI)
🔹 A command interpreter that allows users to interact with the kernel.
🔹 Examples: Bash, Zsh, Fish, Dash, Ksh.
🔹 Converts user commands into system calls for the kernel.
===========================================================================================

2.Explanation of System Directories
a.  /opt=> Used for installing optional third-party software.
b. /srv==>	Holds data for services like web servers (rarely used in containers)
c./var==>	Stores logs, caches, and temporary files that change frequently.
d./etc==>	Stores system configuration files.

Temporary & Volatile Directories
/tmp==>	Temporary files (cleared on reboot).
/run==>	Holds runtime data for processes.
/proc==>	Virtual filesystem for process and system information.
/sys==>	Virtual filesystem for hardware and kernel information.
/dev==>	Contains device files (e.g., /dev/null, /dev/sda).
/mnt==>	Temporary mount point for external filesystems.

User Management in Linux
---------------------------
1./bin
contain basic commands to run Linux
Ex: ls,cp,mv,cat,echo

2./sbin
system admin commands
Mostly used by root user
if admin want to reboot server
Ex:reboot,ifconfig

3./boot
contains files required to boot Linux
kernel files

4./etc
configuration files
stores sytem configuration fules
ex:
/etc/passwd--> user accounts
/etc/hosts--->hostname mapping
/etc/ssh/sshd_config--->ssh config-->if you change ssh port you edit here


4./usr
contains install applications
1.usr/bin--->user commands
2.usr/sbin--->admin commands
3.usr/lib---.libraries

real time
----------
when you install git using 
apt install git
git binaries go into---->/usr/bin/git

5./var
 contains data that changes frequently
/var/logs
/var/chache
real time server has error check

var/log/syslog---->daily activity records

6./proc  
system information
/proc/cpuinfo
/proc/meminfo

7./sys
system hardware info
kernel and hardware details



Diffrence between usr and opt directory
-----------------------------------------
1.why git get install in --->/usr/bin/git
it is installed using os package manager
it become part of system managed software
os will update automatically
software coming form Linux ofical app store

/use--> installed by apt/yum
/usr--->os controlled software

2.why  oracle and java install in /opt
it is third party software
not managed by apt
you control version manully

/opt--user/cp
/opt--> User/company controlled software

You download software form internet and install manually

----------------------------------------------------------------------
/etc--->editable test configuration
/etc we have
1.system configuration files
2.service configuration files
3.user & authentication config
4.secutiy configs


/etc/passwd-->user information
ex--> if we create user that user details will store in /etc/passwd
if we want to update password /etc/shadow

/etc/ssh
main file /etc/ssh/ssh_config
