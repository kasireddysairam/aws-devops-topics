   The Linux Kernel is responsible for directly managing system resources, including:

    Process Management – Schedules processes and handles multitasking.
    Memory Management – Allocates and deallocates RAM efficiently.
    Device Drivers – Acts as an interface between software and hardware.
    File System Management – Manages how data is stored and retrieved.
    Network Management – Handles communication between systems

2.Shell (Command Line Interface - CLI)
🔹 A command interpreter that allows users to interact with the kernel.
🔹 Examples: Bash, Zsh, Fish, Dash, Ksh.
