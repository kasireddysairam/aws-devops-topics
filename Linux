1.Kernel (Core of Linux OS)
   A.The Linux Kernel is responsible for directly managing system resources, including:

    Process Management – Schedules processes and handles multitasking.
    Memory Management – Allocates and deallocates RAM efficiently.
    Device Drivers – Acts as an interface between software and hardware.
    File System Management – Manages how data is stored and retrieved.
    Network Management – Handles communication between systems

B.Shell (Command Line Interface - CLI)
🔹 A command interpreter that allows users to interact with the kernel.
🔹 Examples: Bash, Zsh, Fish, Dash, Ksh.
🔹 Converts user commands into system calls for the kernel.

2.Explanation of System Directories
a.  /opt=> Used for installing optional third-party software.
b. /srv==>	Holds data for services like web servers (rarely used in containers)

Temporary & Volatile Directories
/tmp==>	Temporary files (cleared on reboot).
/run==>	Holds runtime data for processes.
/proc==>	Virtual filesystem for process and system information.
/sys==>	Virtual filesystem for hardware and kernel information.
/dev==>	Contains device files (e.g., /dev/null, /dev/sda).
/mnt==>	Temporary mount point for external filesystems.
